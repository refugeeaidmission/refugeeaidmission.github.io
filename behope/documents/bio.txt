Melissa and Terry Rhodes lived in Bethlehem for seven years working in Christian education.

Surrounded by conflict, a cement barrier wall, three refugee camps, and four checkpoints, Bethlehem is politically and economically challenged. For five years Terry served as high school principal of a Christian school in Bethlehem. Melissa taught high school English, Bible classes, fitness classes, and pre-school classes while living in Bethlehem. Their goals were to encourage the local believers and to reach out to the broader Bethlehem Muslim community and share the hope of Jesus Christ.

During their time in Bethlehem, Terry and Melissa had opportunities to visit refugee camps in Jordan where many Syrian and Iraqi refugees fled ISIS.

In addition to visiting refugees in Jordan, God gave them the opportunity to travel to Iraq and visit refugees and displaced people there. They moved back to the United States in the summer of 2015 and have made visits to Jordan and Iraq since then to visit refugees. 

During a normal visit to Iraq or Jordan, Terry and Melissa will distribute aid (food, toiletries, medical supplies, etc.) and  give the gospel to the refugees. They visit the tents, caravans, and apartments of the refugees, give them food and/or toiletries, pray with them and for them, give them a Bible in their language, and share the good news of the gospel. Through this work they have seen Christian and Muslim background Iraqis, Syrians, Sudanese, and Somalis come to know Jesus, and have been able to give much-needed aid to refugees. They plan to continue to take short term trips to Iraq and Jordan every several months.


Their goals are 
to encourage the local believers in Iraq and Jordan to continue the hard work of reaching out to the refugees there, 
to assist the local believers and missionaries by giving financial aid and sharing the gospel, and 
to inform and invite people in the United States to help with the refugee crisis.
