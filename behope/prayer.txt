PRAYER

James 1:27 says, “Religion that our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.”   

<li>Pray for us as we serve by sharing Jesus with Muslim and Christian refugees.</li>
<li>Pray for us as we reach out in the compassion of Jesus to the poor, widows, refugees, and orphans while encouraging local believers.  </li>
<li>Pray for our upcoming trips that good connections would be made with people working in the camps.</li>
<li>Pray for Northwest Arkansas to become involved in serving the refugees.</li>
<li>Pray for the salvation of the refugees that they would find hope and peace in Jesus.</li>
<li>Pray for the refugees in Iraq and Jordan and those working there.</li>
