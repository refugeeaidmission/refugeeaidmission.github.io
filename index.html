                    <p class="lead">Melissa and Terry Rhodes travel to Iraq and Jordan several times a year to minister to refugees and displaced people.</p>
                    <p>From 2007-2015, Melissa and Terry lived in Bethlehem working in Christian education.</p>
                    <p>Surrounded by conflict, a cement barrier wall, three refugee camps, and four checkpoints, Bethlehem is politically and economically challenged. For five years Terry served as high school principal of a Christian school in Bethlehem. Melissa taught high school English, Bible classes, fitness classes, and pre-school classes while living in Bethlehem. Their goals were to encourage the local believers and to reach out to the broader Bethlehem Muslim community and share the hope of Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>During their time in Bethlehem, Terry and Melissa had opportunities to visit refugee camps in Jordan where many Syrian and Iraqi refugees fled ISIS.</p>
                    <p>In addition to visiting refugees in Jordan, God gave them the opportunity to travel to Iraq and visit refugees and displaced people there.</p>
                    <p class="lead">They moved back to the United States from Bethlehem in the summer of 2015 and have made visits to Jordan and Iraq since then to visit refugees.</p>
                    <p>During a normal visit to Iraq or Jordan, Terry and Melissa will distribute aid (food, toiletries, medical supplies, etc.) and  give the gospel to the refugees. They visit the tents, caravans, and apartments of the refugees, give them food and/or toiletries, pray with them and for them, give them a Bible in their language, and share the good news of the gospel. Through this work they have seen Christian and Muslim background Iraqis, Syrians, Sudanese, and Somalis come to know Jesus, and have been able to give much-needed aid to refugees. They plan to continue to take short term trips to Iraq and Jordan every few months.</p>

He lives in a caravan with his family. <br><br>Before ISIS came to his town and destroyed it, he had a bright future. His dad had a business and he was planning to work with his father and get married. Then ISIS came and Cezar canâ€™t see a future. He does odd jobs to help, but his family home and business are gone. <br><br>He is waiting for ISIS to leave his hometown so that he can go back and rebuild, but in the waiting he has lost hope.</p>

In Mafraq they met a group of Syrian Muslim refugees who are widows and their children. This past Christmas they wanted to share the Christmas story with these widows and they wanted to help them with some necessities: space heaters, mattresses, and food.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We were able to use some funds from Refugee Aid Mission, together with others, and the widows were given a Christmas meal, the heaters and mattresses. The missionaries shared about the miraculous birth of Jesus and gave the widows the gospel in addition to the necessities. What a wonderful way we can serve refugees together!</p>
