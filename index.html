                    <p>Nancy has two babies, a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old. Her husband was deported last year because the government is overloaded with refugees due to all the conflict in the Middle East.</p>

                        <div id="more" style="display:none;">
                            <p>The government is trying to find ways of dealing with the crisis. Nancy and her husband fled due to conflict in their country and after her husband’s deportation she is living alone in the Middle East with no family and no income. Her husband was able to contact her and told her he is trying to find a way to reunite the family. He may try to come back into the Middle East. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            This woman is living in a run-down studio apartment in a slum area. She does her best to care for her babies and hopes that someday she can live in Canada or America with her family. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            We visited her with a refugee aid worker in the Middle East, and during the visit the worker gave her testimony of how Jesus changed her life. Nancy called the worker the day after our visit and said how much that visit encouraged her and how happy she was that someone cared for her. It was a cold cup of water, a small act of compassion, in Jesus’ name.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Refugee Family Aid Branch</h2>
                <p class="lead">The heart of Refugee Aid Mission is its Refugee Family Aid Branch.</p>
                <p>We partner with many local refugee aid workers and pastors to reach out to refugee families. We visit the families and bring them necessities: groceries, heaters, medicine, help with medical procedures, and more. Local workers consistently visit the families and develop relationships with them, finding out what their needs are, and we then give money to provide for their needs.</p>
                <h3>Iraqi Christian refugee families</h3>
                <p>A pastor and his wife have an outreach to Iraqi Christians who have fled Iraq. They have a place called Markez Baraka to distribute grocery vouchers and give Bible studies. They have the head of the house (and maybe the wife or mother) come to the center to pick up grocery vouchers. They have visitors, like us, visit with the refugees before they distribute the vouchers. The center has a large room with a table and chairs and two side rooms to meet. The women prepare tea and then all sit around the table to allow for a time of sharing and teaching for twenty to thirty minutes.  We bought the vouchers for the families. About half of the families were from Mosul, and the other half from Baghdad.</p>
                <p>We spent around three hours at the center visiting with these refugee families and then had lunch with them. We were able to hear many of their stories and share hope from the Bible with them. One of the memorable stories was from a family who fled Baghdad after being harassed by the terrorist and militia groups because they are Christians. After the death of a family member by a bombing, they left with just the clothes on their backs. They arrived recently.  There are many stories like this and we listen and pray for them individually.</p>
                <h3>Syrian refugee families</h3>
                <p>Mahmoud, his wife, and their seven children are from Homs, Syria.  Their children are from three to fourteen years old. The four-year-old is very thin, not growing well, and the oldest is also not very big. They are worried about the 4-year old’s health.  They fled Homs with bombing in full force. They were very frightened when they fled their city. They had to pay a large sum for each one of them to flee and get a ride to safety and to the border. They stayed in a camp at the border in Syria for four months — the children were afraid and having difficulty there. Then they crossed into the bordering country.</p>
                <p>They would like to go back to Syria, but the instability in Syria will not allow this. Their children are at a school, but not getting a good education. One of the oldest, Naser, is 14 and cannot write. He is teased by the teacher and has a difficult time. They want him to be able to get an education. There are many families that we visit like Mahmoud’s. We bring groceries, vitamins, and help with medical bills. In addition, we share hope.</p>
                <h3>House of Faith</h3>
                <p>Refugee aid workers from Argentina run a center called House of Faith. It serves refugee widows and fatherless children. Over forty children come to the center. They host morning and afternoon sessions working with sewing machine training. Our team went to the grocery store and bought groceries for sixteen families. We left groceries for the women attending the sessions. Little Juju goes to the center with his aunt. His father died in the war in Syria, as did his uncle. He lives with his aunt and her children.

                    <p class="lead">Pastor Fernando and Pastor Yagup are supporting a Syrian refugee family as they begin a Refugee Learning Center. </p>
                    <p>Pastor Fernando and his family are active in refugee aid in the Middle East. They perform outreach to around eighty refugee families by home visitation ministry. Their other ministry activities include hosting a youth group, teaching music lessons, pastoring a Hispanic church, leading a women’s ministry teaching crafts, and serving as assistant pastor to a local congregation.</p>
                    <p>Pastor Yagup is the lead pastor of the same local congregation. He and his wife also visit a large number of refugee families of many nationalities.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>One of the Syrian refugee families that Pastor Fernando visited was Abu Rabia and his family. Pastor Fernando and his family had visited Abu Rabia and his family for about three years. Abu Rabia and his family now take our team on home visits to refugee families. This family further serves their Syrian refugee community through education.</p>
                    <p>Abu Rabia and his wife, Kauther, currently tutor many children and teach women how to sew at their house. After working this way for about a year they now need to rent a separate apartment and host more tutoring classes. Refugees like Sabah and Miriam, pictured here, come to their home.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Sabah lives with her husband and two children. Her husband lost his hand in the Syrian war. Sometimes he works as a cleaner. With his small salary they try to cover expenses for their children. She is learning to sew to help provide for her family.</p>
                    <p>Miriam’s husband married a second wife, and now she lives alone with her three children. The two younger children are in school, and the older son works in a restaurant with little payment. Her daughter says that she is not well taught in school, so one of our team members is tutoring her in math.</p>
                    <p>There are many other families benefitting from the Learning Center. Not only do they learn important skills, they also receive hope. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Thirty-five dollars a month will enable a family to attend the center. All donations go directly to the learning center.</p>

                <p class="lead">Mama Mary has helped hundreds of women in prison.</p>
                <p>Mama Mary is a poor, uneducated domestic worker in Middle East. She saw many young African women suffer abuse and injustice as domestic workers. She has helped hundreds of women in prison in the Middle East. She helps them process out of prison, helps provide for their needs, visits them while they are in prison, and gets plane tickets for them to go back to their home countries.</p>
                <p>The women are in prison because they ran away from their “employers”. They left Africa with the understanding that they would work cleaning homes and being nannies for Middle Eastern families. However, many of them find themselves in abusive situations: passports taken, not allowed to leave the home, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and no pay. Out of desperation they run away from the home. When the police pick them up off the streets, they take women to be held in prison for not having their passports. Then Mama Mary will be notified, and she helps women negotiate with the “employers” for the passports and helps the women get plane tickets back to their countries.</p>
                <p>Refugee Aid Mission (RAM) helps to provide for the needs of these prisoners and purchase plane tickets for women who are released to leave prison once their plane ticket is purchased. Many women are waiting in the prisons for a plane ticket. Last year RAM purchased five tickets for women in prison who are now in their home countries, women like Laureen.</p>
                <p class="lead">When you support RAM’s Prison Ministry you help to pay for airplane tickets allowing African women to return home.</p>
