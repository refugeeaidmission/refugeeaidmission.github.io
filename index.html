                    <p>Terry and Melissa worked in the Middle East in education for seven years. Terry served as a high school principal and helped to open a new school in the area. Melissa taught junior high, high school, and preschool age children. In addition to school activities they had a robust ministry with students, their families, and in the community.  They initiated an afterschool program for high school students featuring tutoring, Bible studies, worship, coffee shop, retreats, seminars, fun activities, lots of food, and community outreach projects.</p>
                    <p>For the past three years they have led short term trips to the Middle East partnering with local pastors and missionaries to engage in refugee outreach. They are relocating to the Middle East to be able to host those interested in refugee outreach and to continue to be a presence there.</p>

                    <p>Nancy has two babies, 1 year old and 3 years old. Her husband was deported last year because the government is overloaded with refugees due to all the conflict in the Middle East.</p>

                        <div id="more" style="display:none;">
                            <p>The government is trying to find ways of dealing with the crisis. Nancy and her husband fled due to conflict in their country and after her husband’s deportation she is living alone in the Middle East with no family and no income. Her husband was able to contact her and told her he is trying to find a way to reunite the family. He may try to come back into the Middle East. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            This woman is living in a run-down studio apartment in a slum area. She does her best to care for her babies and hopes that someday she can live in Canada or America with her family. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            We visited her with a missionary in the Middle East, and during the visit the missionary gave her testimony of how Jesus changed her life. Nancy called the missionary the day after our visit and said how much that visit encouraged her and how happy she was that someone cared for her. It was a cold cup of water, a small act of compassion, in Jesus’ name.
